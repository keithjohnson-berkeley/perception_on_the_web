Shortly after you enter yourresponse to one picture, the next one will appear.  There is aprogress counter on the screen that will show you how many picturesare remaining.</p><p>Please type the first word or phrase that you think of when you seethe picture - it could be the name of the object, or the action that isbeing depicted, or some other feeling or property that is suggested by thepicture. Single word answers are perfectly fine.</p><p>Thank you very much for doing this, and for attending carefully to this task!</p><form NAME="consent_questions" onSubmit="return validate(this)"        ACTION="PTrans_trials.php?list=<?php echo $list; ?>&prID=<?php echo $prID; ?>"      METHOD=POST><b>Consent form:</b> <br />Please read the linked <a href="Online_consent_form.pdf", target="_blank">consent form</a>. <br /> Do you consent to participate in this study?	<select NAME="consent">		<option value="">choose</option>		<option VALUE="yes">yes</option>		<option VALUE="no">no</option>	</select></p>	<input TYPE="submit" VALUE="Continue"></form></body></html>
