Response labels will bepresented on the screen, and you use the 'z' key on the keyboard forone response and the 'm' key for the other response. Shortly after youenter your response to a pair, the next one will play.  There is aprogress counter on the screen that will show you how many trialsare remaining.</p><p>Thank you very much for doing this, and for attending carefully to this task!</p><form NAME="consent_questions" onSubmit="return validate(this)"        ACTION="AX_trials.php?list=<?php echo $list; ?>&prID=<?php echo $prID; ?>"       METHOD=POST><b>Consent form:</b> <br />Please read the linked <a href="Online_consent_form.pdf", target="_blank">consent form</a>. <br /> Do you consent to participate in this study?<select NAME="consent">	<option value="">choose</option>	<option value="yes">yes</option>	<option value="no">no</option></select></p><input TYPE="submit" VALUE="Continue"></form></body></html>
